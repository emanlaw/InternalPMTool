```python

        # Enhanced with email, display_name, role, and status
        
    def is_admin(self):
        return self.role == 'admin'
    
    def can_manage_users(self):
        return self.role == 'admin'
```

### Admin Routes
- `GET /admin/users` - Admin user management dashboard
- `POST /admin/users/update_status` - Update user status (approve/reject/suspend)

- `POST /admin/users/bulk_update` - Bulk operations on multiple users
